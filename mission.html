      <h3>5 reasons why our lashes are must have</h3>
      <p>We want you to look and feel better, especially now that you can stop
      envying the models and celebrities in magazines. Eyelash extensions
      instantly dramatically enhance your eyes. They will look bigger, brighter
      and more youthful, and the lashes will also bring out the color of your
      eyes. The compliments will start pouring in, and your confidence will
      increase. When you look good, you feel good!</p>
      <p>You can still do everything you did before. Our extensions look
      natural and are weightless; you will most likely forget that you are
      wearing them. After the first 48 hours, you can go about your business as
      normal. You can even swim and shower with the lashes.</p>
      <p>You will have time to spare. No more rushing in the morning to put on
      your makeup and get out the door. You can sleep in a little longer, because
      Our extensions naturally frame and emphasize your eyes, so curling
      your lashes and applying eye makeup is really not necessary anymore. Also,
      you don’t have to bother taking off eye makeup once the day is done.</p>
      <p>You can save money. Since eyelash extensions look good on their own, you
      don’t have to buy tubes of mascara to bring out your lashes. The days of
      layering mascara, and potentially risking smudges and raccoon eyes, are
      over. You can save the money and get yourself another treat; Perfect your
      <a href="#" id="dentalLink" alt="">smile</a> maybe?</p>
      <p>You can easily maintain the look. Initially getting lash extensions can
      take up to 2 hours, depending on the skill of your lash technician.
      After this, all you have to do is maintain the look by getting touch-ups,
      or so-called fills, every 2 to 3 weeks. In addition to being less expensive,
      fills are less time-consuming; in about 30 minutes, you will leave the salon
      knowing that your lashes look as fabulous as you feel.</p>
